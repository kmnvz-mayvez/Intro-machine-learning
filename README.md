# Machine Learning Introduction

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and computer models capable of learning from data. The primary goal of machine learning is to enable computers to recognize patterns or trends in data and then use this understanding to make predictions or decisions without the need for explicit programming.

## General Steps in Machine Learning

Machine learning involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Collecting relevant and high-quality data is essential for training machine learning models. This data can be in various forms, such as text, images, audio, or other types of data.

2. **Feature Selection:** Selecting the most important features or attributes from the data for use in model creation.

3. **Model Training:** Machine learning models are trained using the training data. This process involves adjusting model parameters so that the model can understand patterns in the data.

4. **Validation and Evaluation:** Models are evaluated using data not used during training to measure how well they can perform the assigned tasks.

5. **Prediction or Decision Making:** After training, models can be utilized to make predictions or decisions based on new data.

These steps are fundamental to the practice of machine learning and are used across various domains, including data analysis, pattern recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics control, predictive modeling, and more.

## Machine Learning Techniques

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is one of the techniques in machine learning that involves predicting the target variable of new data based on a model trained using a labeled dataset.

- **Classification Problems:** In supervised learning, classification problems are used to predict data targets in the form of categories or labels.

- **Regression Problems:** Additionally, supervised learning is also used to predict data targets that are continuous or numeric.

Supervised learning is commonly applied in various applications, including email spam classification, image recognition, and stock price prediction.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is another technique in machine learning that involves predicting the target variable of new data without any labels.

- **Clustering Problems:** In unsupervised learning, clustering problems are used to group training data based on the proximity or similarity of features. The goal is to identify patterns or groups within the data without label information.

- **Data Dimension Reduction (Data Reduction):** Additionally, unsupervised learning is also used for data dimension reduction, which involves grouping input data into several sets of variables that are not correlated with each other. This simplifies the analysis of complex data.

Unsupervised learning has various applications, including customer segmentation, cluster analysis, data dimension reduction, and understanding the structure of complex data.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a learning method that is based on rewarding desirable or undesirable decisions. Reinforcement learning is a technique that focuses on how agents or entities learn to make decisions to achieve certain goals. The agent interacts with the environment, takes actions, and receives rewards or punishments in response to its actions. The main goal of reinforcement learning is to learn policies that maximize rewards in the long term.

Reinforcement learning has wide applications, including in the development of intelligent systems for controlling computer games, autonomous cars, and robotics.

## Factors that Can Contribute to Low Machine Learning Performance
- Errors in the selection of the training model.
- Errors in hyperparameter tuning.
- Inaccurate initial parameter values.
- Insufficient or low-quality training data, referred to as underfitting, or an excess of data causing overfitting.
