# Machine Learning Introduction

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and computer models capable of learning from data. The primary goal of machine learning is to enable computers to recognize patterns or trends in data and then use this understanding to make predictions or decisions without the need for explicit programming.

## General Steps in Machine Learning

Machine learning involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Relevant and high-quality data is required to train machine learning models. This data can be in the form of text, images, audio, or other types of data.

2. **Feature Selection:** Selecting the most important features or attributes in the data to use in model creation.

3. **Model Training:** Machine learning models are trained using the training data. This process involves adjusting model parameters so that the model can understand patterns in the data.

4. **Validation and Evaluation:** Models are evaluated using data not used during training to measure how well they can perform the assigned tasks.

5. **Prediction or Decision Making:** After training, models can be used to make predictions or decisions based on new data.

These steps are fundamental to the practice of machine learning and are used across various domains, including data analysis, pattern recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics control, predictive modeling, and more.
